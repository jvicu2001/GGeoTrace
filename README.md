# GGeoTrace
Graphic Geological Traceroute - See where your connections jump (WIP)

The purpose of this program is to provide a visualization of a traceroute with the help of a geopolitical map (planning on using OpenStreetMap)

### TODO list
- [ ] Implement a traceroute program (choosing between already made solutions or a basic custom made one)
- [ ] Use GeoIP2 database? (Not sure if their license allows to use it for a project like this) (currently using GeoJS web service)
- [ ] GPX builder...
   - [x] With route points representing traceroute jumps
   - [ ] With information about the jumps
      - [x] IP 
      - [x] PTR
      - [ ] Jump delay
      - [ ] Others?
- [ ] Map visualizer (Planning to use Leaflet. Not sure if to use Electron, make a website or whatever)

Please consider that this is an amateur project. I will appreciate any comments on how I can improve my work.
